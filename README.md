# SRE-Bootcamp
SRE Bootcamp that I created using a job description in Google Gemini. 
<p>The prompt was: "Create a bootcamp that would prepare me for this job: {Job Description}"</p>

<p>Once the information is presented, switch to the "Canvas" option in Google Gemini. </p>
<p>Create a prompt like: "Make this into a fun layout for me". Then watch it get to work. <p>

  <p>I asked it to use a SpongeBob theme then copy and pasted the code into my GitHub here and allowed Vercel to access my repo.</p>
